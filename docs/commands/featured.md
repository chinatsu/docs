# Featured commands     

### .featured

Shows the user that is currently featured.

Anyone that is registered in fmbot can get featured, on one condition: They must have used .fmbot in the last day.

To get pinged when you get featured you can [join our server](https://discord.gg/JaHj26hHGk).

Possible featured modes:

* Recent listens
* Weekly albums
* Monthly albums
* Overall albums
* Custom mode (used for events and other special occasions)

If your top album doesn't have a picture, no worries. The bot will just grab the next album that has a picture. The album cover will also be used as the bot's profile picture.
