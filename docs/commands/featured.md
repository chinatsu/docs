# Featured commands     

### .featured

Shows the user that is currently featured.

Anyone that is registered in fmbot can get featured, on one condition: They must have used .fmbot in the last day.

If you get featured, the music you listen to will be the bots avatar for an hour.
People are able to see what and who is featured using `.featured`.

Possible featured modes:

* Recent listens
* Weekly albums
* Monthly albums
* Overall albums
* Custom mode (used for events and other special occasions)

If your top album doesn't have a picture, no worries. The bot will just grab the next album that has a picture.
