### Frequently asked

#### Why a supporter program?

In order to help us pay for hosting, fund development and deal with other expenses we've added a way for people to donate. In return for your support you get some cool exclusive perks.

We're dedicated to making sure the bot remains free and independent. That's why most supporter features are simply features that are nice but would be difficult to roll out to everyone. For example some of the extra statistics require us to store your full listening history, which would be difficult to do for all our users.

By getting supporter you help us to be able to spend more time working on new features and fixes, which in return improves your user experience.

#### Can I see where my money goes?

Yes! We use [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/fmbot), which means that our finances are transparent.

If you go to the [budget category](https://opencollective.com/fmbot#category-BUDGET) on our page it's easy to see where the money comes from and where it goes.

OpenCollective provides funding options for open source projects like ours. It's similar to Patreon, just more transparent and easier when working with multiple people.
