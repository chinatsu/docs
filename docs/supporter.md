# .fmbot supporter

.fmbot is non-commercial and is hosted and maintained by volunteers. In order to help us pay for hosting, fund development and deal with other expenses we've added a way for people to donate and get some small perks in the bot.

We use [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/fmbot) so we can be transparent about our expenses. If you decide to sponsor us, you can see exactly where your money goes.


### Supporters get: 
- More statistics in some commands
- An emote behind their name (‚≠ê)
- Higher chance of being featured every Supporter Sunday (first Sunday of each month)

- Exclusive role and channel on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/6y3jJjtDqK)
