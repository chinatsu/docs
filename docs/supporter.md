### Frequently asked


#### Why a supporter program?

In order to help us pay for hosting, fund development and deal with other expenses we've added a way for people to donate. In return for your support you get some cool exclusive perks.

We're dedicated to making sure the bot remains free and independent. That's why most supporter features are simply features that are nice but would be difficult to roll out to everyone. For example some of the extra statistics require us to store your full listening history, which would be difficult to do for all our users.

By getting supporter you help us to be able to spend more time working on new features and fixes, which in return improves the user experience for everyone.

#### What is OpenCollective?

OpenCollective is like Patreon, except for open source projects. It's also more transparent and easier when working with multiple people.

They manage our funds and allow us to focus on development while they handle the financial side of things.

OpenCollective relies on Stripe to handle their payments, which is one of the worlds biggest payment providers. You can read more about their [security here](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/product/security).

#### Can I see where my money goes?

Yes! We use [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/fmbot) which means that our finances are fully transparent.

If you go to the [budget category](https://opencollective.com/fmbot#category-BUDGET) on our page it's easy to see where the money comes from and where it goes.

#### Can I cancel or change my subscription?

Yes, you can cancel a recurring contribution at any time. To do so, go to [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/) and sign in. After signing in go to 'Manage Contributions' where you can change your subscription.

#### I just bought supporter, what now?

Join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/6y3jJjtDqK) and create a thread in #help. A staff member will apply it to your account as soon as possible.
